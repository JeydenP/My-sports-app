# Real-Time Sports Score App/Website

## About This Project

This is one of my solo projects I wanted to build on my own to practice and take a dive into full-stack development and API's. For this project, I am using The Rundown's powerful REST API. 

As a sports enthusiast, I always enjoyed using apps like ESPN, and my main go to theScore app. So, while watching the NBA finals, I felt like I could take a shot 
and use my software engineering skills to build an app similar to these apps. Although I could improve at web design. I enjoyed building this
site and learning.

## Still A Work In Progress

I have been wanting to get back to this project, but I have been so busy lately applying to jobs and interviewing and working on other projects with my internship at [Project Seldon.](projectseldon.org)

In the future, I want to add more web pages that will show and update the NFL, MLB, and NHL live scores.

## Key Features

- Live updates: The site is set to update the score, time, and quarter every 5 seconds.
- User-Friendly Interface: Right now, I have a real basic design. It's a scoreboard with the team's logos and scores next to it, and it is straightforward to read.
